Project Overview
This project was created as part of my internship with Coding Samurai. It's a dynamic calculator webpage built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Particle.js. The goal was to create an engaging and user-friendly calculator with a modern touch.

Features
Interactive Bubble Background: The eye-catching bubble background is powered by Particle.js, adding a visually appealing element to the calculator.

Button Hover Effects: JavaScript is used to implement custom hover effects on the input buttons, enhancing the user experience.

Sleek Styling: Tailwind CSS was used to style the calculator with a modern and transparent design, giving it a sophisticated look.
